Yumi Sushi is an interactive application for creating personalized sushi orders. Each creation includes a custom name, selected type, chosen ingredients, and a defined price. Optional additions such as a drink or starter are available through a dropdown menu. The system supports full CRUD functionality, enabling the creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of items.
